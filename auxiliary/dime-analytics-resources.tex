\section{Flagship Courses}

\textbf{Manage Successful Impact Evaluations (MSIE).\footnote{
		\url{https://osf.io/h4d8y/}}}
DIME Analytics' flagship training is a week-long annual course,
held in person in Washington, D.C.
MSIE is intended to improve the skills and knowledge of
impact evaluation (IE) practitioners,
familiarizing them with critical issues in
IE implementation, recurring challenges,
and cutting-edge technologies.
The course consists of lectures and hands-on sessions.
Through small group discussions and interactive computer lab sessions,
participants work together to apply what they've learned
and have a first-hand opportunity to develop skills.
Hands-on sessions are offered in parallel tracks,
with different options based on software preferences and skill level.

\resourcepar\textbf{Manage Successful Impact Evaluation Surveys (MSIES).\footnote{
		\url{https://osf.io/resya/}}}
A fully virtual course,
in which participants learn the workflow for primary data collection.
The course covers best practices at all stages of the survey workflow,
from planning to piloting instruments
and monitoring data quality once fieldwork begins.
There is a strong focus throughout on research ethics and reproducible workflows.
The course uses a combination of virtual lectures,
case studies, readings, and hands-on exercises.

\resourcepar\textbf{Research Assistant Onboarding Course.\footnote{
		\url{https://osf.io/qtmdp}}}
This course is designed to familiarize Research Assistants and Research Analysts
with DIME's standards for data work.
By the end of the course's six sessions,
participants will have the tools and knowledge to
implement best practices for transparent and reproducible research.
The course will focus on how to set up a collaborative workflow for
code, datasets, and research outputs.
Most content is platform-independent and software-agnostic,
but participants are expected to be familiar with statistical software.

\resourcepar\textbf{Introduction to R for advanced Stata users\footnote{
		\url{https://osf.io/nj6bf}}}
This course is an introduction to the R programming language,
building upon knowledge of Stata.
The course focuses on common tasks in
development research, related to descriptive analysis,
data visualization, data processing, and geospatial data work.

\resourcepar\textbf{DIME Analytics Trainings.\footnote{
		\url{https://osf.io/wzjtk}}}
DIME Analytics' home on the Open Science Framework,
with links to materials for all past courses and technical trainings.

\section{Software tools and trainings}

\textbf{\texttt{ietoolkit}.\footnote{
		\url{https://github.com/worldbank/ietoolkit}}}
Suite of Stata commands to routinize common tasks for
data management and impact evaluation analysis.

\resourcepar\textbf{\texttt{iefieldkit}.\footnote{
		\url{https://github.com/worldbank/iefieldkit}}}
Suite of Stata commands to routinize 
and document common tasks in primary data collection.

\resourcepar\textbf{DIME Analytics GitHub Trainings and Resources.\footnote{
		\url{https://github.com/worldbank/dime-github-trainings}}}
A GitHub repository containing all
the GitHub training materials and resources developed by DIME Analytics.
The trainings follow DIME's model for organizing research teams on GitHub,
and are designed for face-to-face delivery,
but materials are shared so that they may be used and adapted by others.

\resourcepar\textbf{DIME Analytics \LaTeX-training.\footnote{
		\url{https://github.com/worldbank/DIME-LaTeX-Templates}}}
A user-friendly guide to getting started with LaTeX.
Exercises provide opportunities to
practice creating appendices,
exporting tables from R or Stata to LaTeX,
and formatting tables in LaTeX.
